# Caesar Cipher - Encoding and Decoding

This repository contains a simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher â€” a classic encryption technique used to encode and decode messages using a fixed alphabet shift.

## ðŸ”’ Problem Statement

A Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

For example, with a left shift of 3:

- D becomes A
- E becomes B
- and so on...

The cipher is named after **Julius Caesar**, who used it in his private correspondence.

## ðŸ§  Task

Write Python code that implements:

- **Encoding** a message using Caesar Cipher
- **Decoding** the message back to its original form

### ðŸ”§ Function Parameters:

- `message`: the text to be encoded or decoded.
- `shift`: the number of characters to shift in the alphabet.
